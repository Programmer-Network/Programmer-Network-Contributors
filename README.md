In order to become a contributor on our programmer network platform, you will need to sign our [Contributor Agreement](./Contribution-Agrement.md). This agreement outlines the terms and conditions of your participation on the project, including your responsibilities as a contributor, the expectations for your time commitment, and the process for submitting and reviewing code.

_Please note_ that the [Contributor Agreement](./Contribution-Agrement.md) _can be terminated_ if you are unable to meet the commitments and expectations outlined in the agreement, or if you fail to make a sufficient effort towards the project. The agreement will be signed digitally using a digital signature platform.

Being a contributor on a programmer network platform is a rewarding and challenging experience that requires dedication, communication, and teamwork. As a contributor, you will have the opportunity to collaborate with a team of like-minded individuals, contribute to the growth and development of the platform, and expand your own skills and knowledge.

Here are some key requirements and guidelines to keep in mind as a contributor:

- **Time commitment**: We expect all contributors to commit at least 10 hours per week to the project. This is to ensure that we can make steady progress and meet our goals in a timely manner. If you are unable to meet this requirement, please let us know so that we can adjust your role or responsibilities accordingly.

- **Communication**: We will use Discord and Github Projects as our primary communication channels. It is important that you check in regularly, stay up to date with project updates and tasks, and actively participate in discussions and decision-making.

- **Role and responsibilities**: Each contributor is expected to provide their own goals and areas of focus for the project. Please let us know what you would like to help with, as well as your role and the specific skills or expertise you can bring to the table. This will help us ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals and that we are utilizing everyone's strengths to their full potential.

- **Commits and pull requests**: Each task or feature should be developed in a separate branch and submitted as a pull request for review before it is merged into the main branch. At least one person on the team will need to review the pull request before it can be merged. Please make sure to follow best practices for commit messages and code formatting, and include any relevant details or context in the pull request description.

- **Team meetings**: We will have a weekly team meeting over Discord or Google Hangouts to catch up on progress, discuss any issues or roadblocks, and plan for the upcoming week. The time of the meeting will be decided on a weekly basis based on the availability of all contributors. It is important that you try to attend these meetings or let us know in advance if you are unable to make it.

By following these requirements and guidelines, you will help ensure that our team can work efficiently and effectively towards our common goals. We look forward to your contributions and the valuable insights and perspectives you will bring to the table.
